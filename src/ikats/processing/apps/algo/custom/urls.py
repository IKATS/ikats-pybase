# Configuration file for URL dispatching on custom django application
# ===================================================================
# For detailed description of Rest API refer to:
#  - doc/api_rest/api_rest_algo.yaml
#  - doc/api_rest/README.md
#
# Since [#139805]: following services are available:
# --------------------------------------------------
# Note: for resource customized algo we will manage two information levels: NORMAL or SUMMARY
# (whereas catalogue manages 3 levels : SUMMARY, NORMAL, DETAIL)
#
#
# READ services
# -------------
# GET /custom_algos/ returns JSON encoded SUMMARY view of
#   - all customized_algo, when no query params are passed in url
#   - or filtered search according to defined query parameters named name, label or else desc
#
# GET /custom_algos/{id} returns JSON encoded NORMAL view of specified customized algo
#
# GET /custom_algos/on_implementation/{id} returns JSON encoded SUMMARY view of customized algo
#     customizing implementation with id
#
# CREATE service
# --------------
# POST /custom_algos/ request with
#   - JSON encoded query content as NORMAL view of created customized algo
#   - JSON encoded response as
#                        - either NORMAL view of created customized algo
#                        - or diagnostic: about check status messages
# UPDATE service
# --------------
# PUT /custom_algos/{id} request JSON encoded content updating the resource customized algo with id=...
#   - JSON encoded query content as NORMAL view of updated customized algo
#   - JSON encoded response as
#                        - either NORMAL view of updated customized algo
#                        - or diagnostic: about check status messages
#
# DELETE service
# --------------
# DELETE /custom_algos/{id} simple query without body content, and with
#    - JSON encoded response as
#                       - either NORMAL view of deleted customized algo
#                       - or diagnostic about deleting failure
#
# Deduced URL patterns from Rest services
# ---------------------------------------
# pattern_custom_algos_with_id: /custom_algos/{id}
#   | => function ws_custom.pattern_custom_algos_with_id will
#   | call the good service according to GET/PUT/DELETE http method
#
# pattern_custom_algos_dummy: /custom_algos
#   | => function ws_custom.pattern_custom_algos_dummy will
#   | call the good service according to GET/POST http method
#
# last pattern required: /custom_algos/on_implementation/{id}
#   | => function ws_custom.find_custom_algo_for_implementation
#   | is directly plugged to unique service with GET http method
#
#
# See more details in ws_custom: usage of additional query params ...
