    This class is hosting the implementations of read/write services dealing with resources
      - time-series
      - meta-data
      - process-data
      - ...
    Presently these services have standard implementations
      - by TemporalDataManager (tdm), defining an interface -list of methods and their profile-
      - by NonTemporalDataManager (ntdm), defining an interface -list of methods and their profile-
    Later: mocked, or optimized implementations of these 2 will be developed, following the standard interfaces

    These services ought to be executed in spark context (map/reduce) by executors.

    How to initialize the ResourceLocator services ?
      - this class is a singleton: initialization is run once per process
        - default call: ResourceLocator()
          - ResourceLocator() will read standard deployment configuration file, calling internal __load_from_file__()
            - Assumed: configuration file(s) are deployed on the cluster to enable load_config()
        - explicit initialization ResourceLocator(tdm=..., ntdm=..., ... ) ought to be reserved to mocked tests,
            - specific implementations of tdm/ntdm ought to be used in that case
            - presently: syntax requires kwargs arguments for names tdm and ntdm.
              This could be extended later to new resource managers

    How to call a service from ResourceLocator ?
      - example: a service from tdm interface:
        - ResourceLocator().tdm.get_ts(...) is equivalent to:
          RessourceLocator.get_singleton().get_tdm().get_ts(...)
            - get_ts(...) has the same profile as the method on TemporalDataManager method get_ts()

      - it is the same for other services on TemporalDataManager
        -  ResourceLocator().tdm.<service>(...)
      - and the same for all services on NonTemporalDataManager
        -  ResourceLocator().ntdm.<service>(...)
